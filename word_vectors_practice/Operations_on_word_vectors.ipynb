    "In the following exercise, you will examine gender biases that can be reflected in a word embedding, and explore algorithms for reducing the bias. In addition to learning about the topic of debiasing, this exercise will also help hone your intuition about what word vectors are doing. This section involves a bit of linear algebra, though you can probably complete it even without being an expert in linear algebra, and we encourage you to give it a shot. This portion of the notebook is optional and is not graded. \n",

    "Lets first see how the GloVe word embeddings relate to gender. You will first compute a vector $g = e_{woman}-e_{man}$, where $e_{woman}$ represents the word vector corresponding to the word *woman*, and $e_{man}$ corresponds to the word vector corresponding to the word *man*. The resulting vector $g$ roughly encodes the concept of \"gender\". (You might get a more accurate representation if you compute $g_1 = e_{mother}-e_{father}$, $g_2 = e_{girl}-e_{boy}$, etc. and average over them. But just using $e_{woman}-e_{man}$ will give good enough results for now.) \n"

Note that some word pairs such as \"actor\"/\"actress\" or \"grandmother\"/\"grandfather\" should remain gender specific, while other words such as \"receptionist\" or \"technology\" should be neutralized, i.e. not be gender-related. You will have to treat these two types of words differently when debiasing.\n",

    "The figure below should help you visualize what neutralizing does. If you're using a 50-dimensional word embedding, the 50 dimensional space can be split into two parts: The bias-direction $g$, and the remaining 49 dimensions, which we'll call $g_{\\perp}$. In linear algebra, we say that the 49 dimensional $g_{\\perp}$ is perpendicular (or \"orthogonal\") to $g$, meaning it is at 90 degrees to $g$. The neutralization step takes a vector such as $e_{receptionist}$ and zeros out the component in the direction of $g$, giving us $e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$. \n",

As a concrete example, suppose that \"actress\" is closer to \"babysit\" than \"actor.\" By applying neutralizing to \"babysit\" we can reduce the gender-stereotype associated with babysitting. But this still does not guarantee that \"actor\" and \"actress\" are equidistant from \"babysit.\" The equalization algorithm takes care of this. \n",

    "These debiasing algorithms are very helpful for reducing bias, but are not perfect and do not eliminate all traces of bias. For example, one weakness of this implementation was that the bias direction $g$ was defined using only the pair of words _woman_ and _man_. As discussed earlier, if $g$ were defined by computing $g_1 = e_{woman} - e_{man}$; $g_2 = e_{mother} - e_{father}$; $g_3 = e_{girl} - e_{boy}$; and so on and averaging over them, you would obtain a better estimate of the \"gender\" dimension in the 50 dimensional word embedding space. Feel free to play with such variants as well.  \n",
